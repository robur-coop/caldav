- which XML properties are supported (see webdav.ml:create_properties)?  which can be modified by a client?
- do we implement the right HTTP error codes?
- caldav collection properties (RFC 4791 Sec 5.2)
- MKCALENDAR HTTP verb (RFC 4791 Sec 5.3)
- REPORT (from CalDAV including XML requests, answers, collation)
- tests (wir haben: icalendar/ics, webdav-xml. was fehlt: webdav/http und caldav/http)
- apple's ist umfangreich - dokumentieren was schon funktioniert und was wir denken, dass funktionieren sollte

- Access control (both WebDAV and CalDAV layers)
- service discovery of calendars
- Persistent storage
- WebUI

DONE:
- client interoperability: thunderbird! calendar.app! create and delete and rename event, todo
- slash normalisation with prefix
- timezone and date normalisation
- finish tests for access control for all verbs
- implement access control for report, and covered by test suite
- access control (WebDAV)
- user management (config file: users, hostname, routing, etc.)
- how to add user and set acl
- unsafe_find and unsafe_add: comment reasons
- test access control with apple and thunderbird
- readonly xml props (sind live properties) - there may still be more (in caldav/acl)
- access control into separate module
- move stuff to webdav_api
- curl command to add a user, delete a user, access control, change password
- curl command to add group, add group members, delete group members, delete group
- add custom salting
- mode for TOFU (everybody can create their user if not already taken)
- ACL/policy configuration via property in root folder
- configure default group membership for newly created users via webdav property
- make a mirage unikernel
- unikernel parameter: http vs https (certificates), root password, file system root / data directory, trust on first use, hostname
- remove hardcoded users
- stored URLs contain scheme, hostname, and port
--> should instead be relative!?
--> or absolute, but not containing scheme, hostname, port
- test and adapt calendar-home-set with multiple entries:
 - does it work with clients? no
 - which path is a "new calendar" created in? unclear
 => man kann alles in ein verzeichnis dumpen, filenames sind uniqe
- put all calendars into one dir, control access via acl
- fix deletion of calendars
- Fs.to_string should return a leading /
- client interoperability: android! create new todo lists and new calendars, use different users
- attachments
- automatic discovery of calendar url
  - .well-known/caldav is supported
  - DNS TXT record is out of scope for caldav
- add group calendar, remove group calendar
- persistent storage (irmin/git?) (mirage-fs-unix works for us!)
- test read-only (group) calendar - check whether client report properly back that they can't create an event
- make a running calendar server for robur internally
- monitoring (status code, measure duration between request and reply)
- rework Logging: less messages, more useful data
- unit test: check on disk if parent updates lastmodified when kid writes 
- unit test: check on disk if parent updates lastmodified when kid deletes 

-- TODO next

- getetag may not exist on disk, who updates it for directories when resources are modified?
   - check on disk if parent updates etag when kid writes
   - check on disk if parent updates etag when kid deletes
- add test to delete in directory, last-modified + etag of parent must change!
- how to give ownership of a calendar to a group
- how to modify robur_ns, "newgroups"
- how to modify default policy for calendars?
- relative path/urls, simplify Webdav_api.uri_string

-- TODO before release

- apache benchmark - how many requests per second are possible for GET/PUT/DELETE?
  - many concurrent GETs of the same event --> 200
    - 1000 requests, 1 connection: Requests per second: 40.71 [#/sec] (mean)
    - 1000 requests, 5 connections: Requests per second: 71.81 [#/sec] (mean)
    - 1000 requests, 10 connections: Requests per second: 74.98 [#/sec] (mean)
    - 1000 requests, 15/17 connections: Requests per second: 74.45 [#/sec] (mean)
    - 1000 requests, 20 connections: test aborted after 10 failures, 95 requests completed
    - 1000 requests, 25 connections: test aborted after 10 failures
    - 1000 requests, 50 connections: test aborted after 10 failures
  - calendar with many events, listing (server has to append all events)
    - 1000 items, 10 requests, 1 connection: Time per request: 3595.288 [ms] (mean)
  - while doing a big REPORT, others are waiting for this request to finish
    - takes > 40s when one REPORT on 1000 items is done, and a single GET
- profile why a report with 1000 ics files is slow (cpu bound? io bound? - test with mirage-fs-mem) find out which function is the bottleneck
- SLA: 30s? how many items are allowed to meet this SLA? how to setup a limit?
- replayable log to discover client usage of the HTTP endpoints
  - design an experiment and warn users
- how to set (Xml.robur_ns, "default_groups")?
- configure default acl for calendars as "public" or "private"
  - per user? per server?
  - who can configure that?
 - script to make calendar public / private
  - curl commands to make calendar public/private/read-only/protected (freebusy only)
  - a private calendar which should turn into a public one: how to adjust all the event ACLs? maybe DAV:inherited ACL?
- access control XML content when forbidden
  - for a resource where GET is forbidden, check that PROPFIND is also forbidden
- check that all exposed functions in webdav_api (HTTP requests) checks ACL before accessing data
- test internationalisation (unicode)
  - create and delete events with unicode data in summary
  - umlauts, chinese characters, danish crossed o, japanese, indian
  - right-to-left
  - test properties: keys and values
- report time-range: may have only one of start or end
  - test: may lead to recurring events that occur forever -> DoS?
  - limit how many days in recur_events (upper limit 500 days)
  - limit how many events are returned by server
  - limit how many events are in a calendar
  - limit byte-size of each event before storing on disk (maybe 1MB)
- rename calendars (displayname) to include hostname
- warn that ics CLASS property not supported, "may lead to data leaks"
  - describe workaround to set ACL via curl
- describe we don't support EXDATE RDATE
- report issue to cohttp:
  http request with query parameter that is empty leads to an empty reply:
   curl -v -X PUT "http://root:toor@127.0.0.1:8080/user?name=user5&password= &foo=bar"
 - describe in our docs this known bug
- revise client interop documentation
  - davdroid needs to start with "http(s)://"
  - FirefoxOS needs a trailing /calendars
- document client behaviour for creating events in read-only calendars
  - calendar.app on macos reports an error and lets me revert to server
  - davdroid doesn't report an error, davdroid pretends it was written on the server even on sync
  - ipad doesn't report an error, event disappears on sync

-- TODO for sure after release

- blackberry comma topic, debug with mato
- KV updates for irmin/git, weekly check with thomas
- getlastmodified is not being updated on a directory if a file in it is deleted

-- NICE to have

- check TODOs in the code and fix
- check assert false in the code and fix
- research scope of implementing calendar sharing
 - calendar sharing
  - free-busy-query report
   - component_in_timerange implementations (todo/freebusy)
  - inboxes
- report text-match
- icalendar CLASS property: public / private / ...
  - do clients set this property? android davdroid can do this
  - server may use this to infer whether an event should be shown
  - we already support acl per event
    - if acl changes, modify CLASS property
- sync-collection (WebDAV) ctag
  - faster sync
  - less computational work for server
- webUI
- recurence exdate, rdate: for now, we don't support this
- more tests from apple's test suite
- preserve creation-date on write_component if it was already there
  - when an event is modified, Webdav_api.write_component is used to write it to disk.
    this function uses Properties.create, which records the current timestamp for
    both creationTime and modificationTime.
  - correct behaviour: set only modificationTime on modification
- report CalDAV 7.8.6 - 7.8.10
   - 7.8.6 Example: Retrieval of Event by UID
   - 7.8.7.  Example: Retrieval of Events by PARTSTAT
   - 7.8.8.  Example: Retrieval of Events Only
   - 7.8.9.  Example: Retrieval of All Pending To-Dos
   - 7.8.10. Example: Attempt to Query Unsupported Property
- recurrence < daily

-- milestone supporting full WebDAV

- implement ACL for writing acls, forbid to write acl in PROPPATCH / MKCOL / MKCALENDAR
- locking (WebDAV)
